There are fewer manufacturing jobs in America every year. While industrial output has increased, the expanding role of automation has meant fewer Americans actually at work making things. This data is from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).  1939 was the first year this information was recorded by BLS. The number of manufacturing jobs is listed by month. I took an annual average and used that average to represent the whole year. The impact of World War Two is apparent in the spike  in manufacturing jobs between 1939 and 1945.
